                        approached the Greenhouse with a potential opportunity for U.S. Bank
                        Payments to leverage an emerging technology, ambient payments,
                        in order to capture a new customer segment. Toddler and his team
                        completed preliminary investigations which led to the creating of an

                        the Greenhouse suggested to Todder that we shoudl design a prototype
                        which would showcae the potential for ambient technology and use that
                        design to solicit feedback from real merchants.
